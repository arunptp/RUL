Rapid adoption of renewable energy sources, changes in regulatory environment with the implementation of SCED/MBED, stringent enviromental norms are putting immense pressure on operation of thermal power plants. The above externalities are forcing increased cyclic operation of thermal fleets, wherein frequent start up and shutdowns are causing varying load on assets like boilers, feed pumps, motors, pipes. Under such conditions, ensuring availiablity and safety of equipments is of prime significance. Consequently, utilities needs to strategize for a transition from a reactive maintenance approach to real time condition based health management eventually leading to preventive maintenance (PdM). This webpage illustrates estimation of residual useful life (RUL) of an equipment using deep learning. The equipment is operating normally at the start of each time series, and develops a fault at some point during the series. In the training set, the fault grows in magnitude until system failure. In the test set, the time series ends some time prior to system failure. The objective is to predict, "What is the probability that the equipment will fail in the next n cycles/days?". A datascience based process is utilized for predictive maintenance. The steps include preparing the dataset, visually exploring it, partioning the dataset for training and validation, validating the models using unseen dataset.
